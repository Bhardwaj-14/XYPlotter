**XY Plotter**

What?:
A low cost simple writing robot that can draw or write anything you send to it with intense accuracy. 

The WHY?:
We built it to help with homework, and we in turn would focus on making things!
Moreover Indian homework is just a chatGPT'/book copy paste thingy tbh.

Team:

*Bhardwaj Prasad Sutara

*Atul Kumar Mishra

*Dishant Singh

What We Did:
Atul came up with the idea after staring at unfinished homework. Bhardwaj(I) handled the wiring and software, while Dishant modeled the parts in Onshape. We worked together to build a working XY plotter from scratch.

Tools used:
*Cirkit Designer (wiring) {https://app.cirkitdesigner.com/}
*Onshape (3D design)

Parts:
Arduino + Stepper Motors and some 3D printed parts
