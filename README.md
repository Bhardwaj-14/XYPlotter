# XY Plotter

**What?:**
A low cost simple writing robot that can draw or write anything you send to it with intense accuracy. 

**The WHY?:**
We built it to help with homework, and we in turn would focus on making things!
Moreover Indian homework is just a chatGPT'/book copy paste thingy tbh.

**Team:**

*Bhardwaj Prasad Sutara

*Atul Kumar Mishra

*Dishant Singh

**What We Did:**
Atul came up with the idea after staring at unfinished homework. Bhardwaj(I) handled the wiring and software, while Dishant modeled the parts in Onshape. We worked together to build a working XY plotter from scratch.

This is the wiring

![Wiring_Diagram(FINAL)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3011318-92b6-4ee0-b3f4-99cf40ddf4c3)

Tools used:
*Cirkit Designer (wiring) {https://app.cirkitdesigner.com/}
*Onshape (3D design)

Parts:
Arduino + Stepper Motors and some 3D printed parts



# How to build

*Print all the parts and buy the electronics required(for electronics, refer to the BOM)

*Refer to the wiring diagram and connect all the parts together properly.

*Connect the arduino to PC to power it up and power the motor drivers and you are good to go!


The Final thing looks like this(3D version)
