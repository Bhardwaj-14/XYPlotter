**XY Plotter**
A low cost simple writing robot that can draw or write anything you send to it with intense accuracy. We built it to help with homework, and we in turn would focus on making things!

Team:
Bhardwaj Prasad Sutara

Atul Kumar Mishra

Dishant Singh

What We Did
Atul came up with the idea after staring at unfinished homework. Bhardwaj handled the wiring and software, while Dishant modeled the parts in Onshape. We worked together to build a working XY plotter from scratch.

Tools used:
Cirkit Designer (wiring)

Onshape (3D design)

Arduino + Stepper Motors and some 3D printed parts
